# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Amazon-Product-Reviews

This project predicts positive or negative sentiment of Amazon fine food product reviews, and evaluates the performance of machine learning models such as Naive Bayes, Linear Support Vector Classifier, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest Classifier.First I did data cleaning and preprocessing, and made model selection. Then, I tuned the hyperparameters using GridSearchCV. Finally, I chose the best model for the proposed data.

The followings are links for data and models.
